### PRINCIPLES
**Wisdom:**

The first principle in Buddhish philosophy is to cultivate wisdom. You do this by continuously working to expand your knowledge. Knowledge is the accumulation of facts, and wisdom is the sound application of knowledge.

Dedicate time each day to learning and use that knowledge to help others. As you cultivate wisdom and accumulate facts, you must seek the truth. You should question assumptions and seek opposing facts. 

Any belief you hold must be replaced by facts when you discover them.
Wisdom is realizing that your mind causes much of your suffering in life. By training your mind and changing your thinking, you can reduce stress and unhappiness in your life.

Wisdom is using your knowledge to help others.

**Calmness:**

The second principle in Buddhish philosophy is to develop calmness, mental focus, and clarity through meditation. Calmness can be developed through practicing concentration.

Spend time each day training your mind to focus on one object, like a mantra or your breath. Concentrate on slowly breathing in and out, and return to the next breath if your mind wanders. Repeat the mantra “be wise, be calm, be kind.” This will allow you to gain control of your thoughts and ease your stress and suffering.
Use your mental focus to pay attention to the present moment without judgment.

Concentrate on controlling your thoughts, abandoning negative mindsets, and cultivating positive ones.

Think before you speak and exercise moderation and restraint in all you do.

Behave morally and ethically. Refrain from stealing and lying. Keep your promises.

**Kindness:**

The third principle in Buddhish philosophy is to be kind. Respect all life. Practice non-violence and compassion toward all living beings.

Cultivate thoughts of loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom toward others. Speak kindly and truthfully. Avoid gossip and harsh language when talking to people.

Earn a living ethically and honestly. Act as though your actions have consequences and shape future experiences.

Pause before you speak or act, and ask if it is wise, apt, or kind.

Above all, be kind to everyone—including yourself.
