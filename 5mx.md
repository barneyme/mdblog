5MX - Five Mindful Exercises Routine
The 5MX is inspired by 5BX Canadian Air force exercise plan for pilots developed in the 1960s. The 5MX routine combines mindfulness and gentle exercises and can .

### 1. Mountain Pose: Grounding
Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, or closer if comfortable. Let your arms rest by your sides with palms facing forward. Distribute your weight evenly across both feet. Gently engage your thigh muscles and tuck your tailbone slightly. Lengthen your spine, roll your shoulders back and down, and lift the crown of your head toward the ceiling. Soften your jaw and your gaze.

### 2. Upward Reach with Side Bend: Lengthening the Arms & Sides
From Mountain Pose, inhale and sweep your arms out and up overhead. You can interlace your fingers, pointing your index fingers up, or keep your palms facing each other. On an exhale, gently lean to your right, feeling a stretch along your left side. Inhale to return to the center. Exhale and lean to your left, feeling the stretch on your right side.

### 3. Standing Cat-Cow: Mobilizing the Back
Place your hands on your thighs, just above your knees. Soften your knees into a slight bend. As you inhale, gently arch your back, dropping your belly, lifting your chest and gaze forward (Cow Pose). As you exhale, round your spine, tucking your chin to your chest and pressing your mid-back towards the ceiling (Cat Pose).

### 4. Chair Pose: Building Energy
From a standing position, with feet hip-width apart, inhale and raise your arms forward or overhead. As you exhale, bend your knees and send your hips back and down, as if you were about to sit in a chair. Keep your chest lifted and your weight primarily in your heels (you should be able to wiggle your toes).

### 5. Forward Fold with Ragdoll Arms: Releasing Tension
From Chair Pose, exhale and straighten your legs as you hinge at your hips, folding forward. Keep a generous bend in your knees to protect your lower back. Let your head and neck hang heavy. You can grasp opposite elbows with opposite hands.
To conclude, release your arms, keep your knees bent, and very slowly roll up to standing, one vertebra at a time, with your head being the last thing to lift. Stand in Mountain Pose for a final moment, noticing any new sensations in your body before continuing with your day.
